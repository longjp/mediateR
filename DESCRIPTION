Version: 0.1.0
Author: James P Long
Maintainer: <jplong@mdanderson.org>
Description: Computes direct and indirect effects (mediation analysis) with multiple potential mediators and various mediator-outcome models (linear, logistics, cox proportional hazards). The mediator structure does not need to be specified and confounders can be included in the model. The package has special functionality for computing mediation effects on the odds scale (useful for logistic models) and restricted mean scale (useful for the Cox proportional hazards model).
